# playground

A small clojure program to calculate the square roots of different numbers.

## Usage

Can calculate the square roots for perfect squares & imperfect squares (represented as irrational numbers).

In the case of negative numbers, NAN is actually a correct output. Since the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number. For instance, the square root of -4 is 2 i, where i stands for imaginary.  

Use Leiningrad for best results. However you can also run 
$ java -jar playground-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
